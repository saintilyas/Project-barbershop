                    <p>Many of us Chaps including myself can often shy away from reinventing ourselves. We almost become too comfortable with our current styles and miss out on current trends.
                    <br>
                    You may think a restyle would involve a big change of image but you would be surprised just how often very little is required to achieve something new.
                    <br>
                    It’s true that style and fashion repeats throughout history. However, cutting tools continue to advance and therefore barbers advance with them. This means there is always a wide spectrum on which to make big or small changes to stay current and have an impact on your look.
                    <br>
                    The reason I asked if you were committed, is because the second you enter Chaps & Co, not only are we committed to providing you with best customer service, but also the best possible outcome that you can manage with confidence. Without confidence, you should never commit, so it’s our job to create the bridge between clarity and confusion 
                    <br>
                    Here’s a few tips to help you on your restyle journey.</p>
                    <h3>Make Sure Your Vision is Realistic</h3>
                    <p>As much as I’d love to say anything is possible, the harsh reality is that not everything is. However, if you come with a realistic vision there will always be options very close to your desired result. In order to make sure you’re being realistic – consider things like your hair color, your hair density, is your hair porous? How long is your hair? Then compare it to the image of your desired result.</p>
                    <h3>Communicate with your Barber</h3>
                    <p>Communication is key when trying to achieve any goal. Once you have your desired result in mind, bring this up during the consultation process with your barber. He/she will advise you on multiple factors such as your head and face shape and how it will suit you, your lifestyle, your personality and character. This is the most important part of the service, where your vision is brought to life. Use this time and ask as many questions as you like. Always remember, confidence is what creates commitment.</p>
                    <h3>Accept the Advice from the Professionals</h3>
                    <p>Just like many other professions, barbering is a craft that has to be practiced daily in order to be perfect, your barber will have spent endless hours with countless people with different head shapes, hair color and hair type. Trust their advice, because a good barber isn’t thinking about just the haircut or beard trim, they are thinking of your overall image as one complete person and how they can project your individuality using their skill.</p>
                    <h3>Health and Maintenance</h3>
                    <p>So now you’re looking handsome! Let’s talk about health and maintenance. Did you know that the only time your hair is actually alive is when it is beneath the epidermis. That means that every single hair visible to you is dead. It’s essential to use the correct treatments, shampoo and conditioner to suit your hair type and skin type. This is another must to discuss with your barber to ensure you get the right hair care products, try it for one month and see the dramatic results for yourself.</p>
                    <h3>The Styling Process</h3>
                    <p>There are many products on the market that do many different things for varying hair types. It’s for this reason we have such a wide range of brands at Chaps & Co. Some products are heat activated where as some are not, your barber can help explain this process to you. In my 17 years of experience the most effective way to sustain your look is to use (what I refer to as) internal and external products.
                    <br><br>
                    The internal product is the first product, its job is to create scaffolding for the hair, for example – blow-drying the BBA moulding cream into wet hair helps create long lasting volume.
                    <br>
                    The external product is then applied to sustain the shape once the first product has been set – applying the BBA texture clay to the hair, once dry, will help to achieve minimum or maximum texture. 
                    <br>
                    When combined you will have a longer lasting look that has less chance of collapsing due to daily activities in various climates.
                    <br>
                    My final tip – would be to always give feedback, as we are always striving to reach our full potential and to give you the best service possible as a team.
                    <br>
                    If you are after a new look, you can book a consultation or restyle through our website, app or Fresha.
